## Career Objectives

I have an interest in financial services and have been looking into financial/equity research. I am interested in finance, but feel like with my engineering background I would be more interested working in a more technical space. That's the reason I believe it'd be the right fit for me.

## Hobbies

I really enjoy baseball analytics, poker, and excel modeling.
